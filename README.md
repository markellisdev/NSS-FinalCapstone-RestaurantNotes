# NSS-FinalCapstone-RestaurantNotes

This is the backend API built for my "Restaurant Notes" application. You will find the Ionic 2 application here, "Restaurant Notes Ionic 2".

To use this application, you'll first need to pull down this repo and install.
I will be including steps to follow, but for now as I'm still building and testing, I don't have them formally written out. 03-25-2017

As of yet, there's no migration to pre-populate your database, but that will follow also. 03-25-2017
